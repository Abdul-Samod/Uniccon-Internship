"Oh,how I wish I could shut up like a telescope",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I think I could, if I onlyknew how to begin",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"For, you see, so many outoftheway things hadhappened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few thingsindeed were really impossible",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"It was all very well to say Drink me, but the wise little Alice wasnot going to do that in a hurry",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
What a curious feeling,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
said Alice; I must be shutting up like atelescope,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Iwonder what I should be like then,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"And she tried to fancy what theflame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she couldnot remember ever having seen such a thing",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on goinginto the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Come, theres no use in crying like that",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"said Alice to herself,rather sharply; I advise you to leave off this minute",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"But its no use now, thought poor Alice, to pretend to be twopeople",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Why, theres hardly enough of me left to make one respectableperson",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, Which way",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
The Pool of TearsCuriouser and curiouser,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"cried Alice she was so much surprised, thatfor the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English; now Imopening out like the largest telescope that ever was",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out ofsight, they were getting so far off",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Oh, my poor little feet, Iwonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Imsure I shant be able,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Let me see: Ill give them a new pair of boots everyChristmas,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"They mustgo by the carrier, she thought; and how funny itll seem, sendingpresents to ones own feet",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
And how odd the directions will look,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland

"Oh dear, what nonsense Im talking",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"You ought to be ashamed of yourself, said Alice, a great girl likeyou, she might well say this, to go on crying in this way",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Stopthis moment, I tell you",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"But she went on all the same, sheddinggallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, aboutfour inches deep and reaching half down the hall",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, andshe hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
wont she be savage if Ive kept her waiting,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, shekept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: Dear, dear",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Howqueer everything is today,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
And yesterday things went on just as usual,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
I wonder if Ive been changed in the night,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Let me think: was I thesame when I got up this morning,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
I almost think I can remember feelinga little different,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"But if Im not the same, the next question is, Whoin the world am I",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Ah, thats the great puzzle",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"And she beganthinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age asherself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
she knows such avery little,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Besides, shes she, and Im I, andoh dear, howpuzzling it all is",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Ill try if I know all the things I used to know,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen,and four times seven isoh dear",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland

ever so many lessons to learn,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"No, Ivemade up my mind about it; if Im Mabel, Ill stay down here",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Itll beno use their putting their heads down and saying Come up again, dear",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
I shall only look up and say Who am I then,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Tell me that first, andthen, if I like being that person, Ill come up: if not, Ill stay downhere till Im somebody elsebut, oh dear",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"cried Alice, with a suddenburst of tears, I do wish they would put their heads down",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
I am sovery tired of being all alone here,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to seethat she had put on one of the Rabbits little white kid gloves whileshe was talking",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
How can I have done that,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
I must begrowing small again,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
That was a narrow escape,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"said Alice, a good deal frightened at thesudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; andnow for the garden",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"and she ran with all speed back to the littledoor: but, alas",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"And I declare its too bad, that it is",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment,splash",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
she was up to her chin in salt water,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Her first idea was thatshe had somehow fallen into the sea, and in that case I can go back byrailway, she said to herself",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"However, shesoon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept whenshe was nine feet high",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
I wish I hadnt cried so much,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"said Alice, as she swam about, tryingto find her way out",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, bybeing drowned in my own tears",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"That will be a queer thing, to besure",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"However, everything is queer today",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Would it be of any use, now, thought Alice, to speak to this mouse",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Everything is so outoftheway down here, that I should think verylikely it can talk: at any rate, theres no harm in trying",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"So shebegan: O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I am very tiredof swimming about here, O Mouse",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"The Mouse looked at her ratherinquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,but it said nothing",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Perhaps it doesnt understand English, thought Alice; I daresay itsa French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"For, with allher knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long agoanything had happened",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
So she began again: O est ma chatte,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
whichwas the first sentence in her French lessonbook,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"The Mouse gave asudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over withfright",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Oh, I beg your pardon",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"cried Alice hastily, afraid that shehad hurt the poor animals feelings",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
I quite forgot you didnt likecats,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Wouldyou like cats if you were me,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Well, perhaps not, said Alice in a soothing tone: dont be angryabout it",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think youdtake a fancy to cats if you could only see her,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling allover, and she felt certain it must be really offended",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
We wont talkabout her any more if youd rather not,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of histail",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
As if I would talk on such a subject,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Our family alwayshated cats: nasty, low, vulgar things",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Dont let me hear the nameagain,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject ofconversation",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Are youare you fondofof dogs,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"The Mouse did notanswer, so Alice went on eagerly: There is such a nice little dog nearour house I should like to show you",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"A little brighteyed terrier, youknow, with oh, such long curly brown hair",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
He saysit kills all the rats andoh dear,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"cried Alice in a sorrowful tone,Im afraid Ive offended it again",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"For the Mouse was swimming awayfrom her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in thepool as it went",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"So she called softly after it, Mouse dear",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Do come back again, and wewont talk about cats or dogs either, if you dont like them",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Aliceled the way, and the whole party swam to the shore",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,called out, Sit down, all of you, and listen to me",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Ill soon makeyou dry enough,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with theMouse in the middle",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for shefelt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"said the Mouse with an important air, are you all ready",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Thisis the driest thing I know,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Silence all round, if you please",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Williamthe Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submittedto by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late muchaccustomed to usurpation and conquest",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Edwin and Morcar, the earls ofMercia and NorthumbriaUgh",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"said the Lory, with a shiver",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
I beg your pardon,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: Didyou speak",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
said the Lory hastily,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I thought you did, said the Mouse",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Edwin and Morcar,the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and evenStigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisableFound what",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Found it, the Mouse replied rather crossly: of course you knowwhat it means",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I know what it means well enough, when I find a thing, said theDuck: its generally a frog or a worm",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"The question is, what did thearchbishop find",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, foundit advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer himthe crown",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Williams conduct at first was moderate,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"But the insolenceof his Normans How are you getting on now, my dear",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"it continued,turning to Alice as it spoke",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"As wet as ever, said Alice in a melancholy tone: it doesnt seem todry me at all",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"In that case, said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, I movethat the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energeticremediesSpeak English",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I dont know the meaning of halfthose long words, and, whats more, I dont believe you do either",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Andthe Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birdstittered audibly,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"What I was going to say, said the Dodo in an offended tone, was,that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucusrace",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
What is a Caucusrace,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"said Alice; not that she wanted much toknow, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that somebody ought tospeak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Why, said the Dodo, the best way to explain it is to do it",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"And,as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I willtell you how the Dodo managed it",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"First it marked out a racecourse, in a sort of circle, the exactshape doesnt matter, it said, and then all the party were placedalong the course, here and there",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"However,when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dryagain, the Dodo suddenly called out The race is over",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"and they allcrowded round it, panting, and asking, But who has won",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"At last the Dodosaid, Everybody has won, and all must have prizes",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
But who is to give the prizes,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
quite a chorus of voices asked,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Why, she, of course, said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with onefinger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in aconfused way, Prizes",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"There was exactlyone apiece, all round",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"But she must have a prize herself, you know, said the Mouse",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Of course, the Dodo replied very gravely",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
What else have you got inyour pocket,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"he went on, turning to Alice",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Only a thimble, said Alice sadly",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Hand it over here, said the Dodo",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, andbegged the Mouse to tell them something more",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"You promised to tell me your history, you know, said Alice, and whyit is you hateC and D, she added in a whisper, half afraid that itwould be offended again",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Mine is a long and a sad tale,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"said the Mouse, turning to Alice, andsighing",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"It is a long tail, certainly, said Alice, looking down with wonderat the Mouses tail; but why do you call it sad",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Come, Ill take no denial; We must have a trial: For really this morning Ive nothing to do",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Said the mouse to the cur, Such a trial, dear sir, With no jury or judge, would be wasting our breath",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Ill be judge, Ill be jury, Said cunning old Fury: Ill try the whole cause, and condemn you to death",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
You are not attending,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
said the Mouse to Alice severely,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
What areyou thinking of,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I beg your pardon, said Alice very humbly: you had got to the fifthbend, I think",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and lookinganxiously about her",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Oh, do let me help to undo it",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I shall do nothing of the sort, said the Mouse, getting up andwalking away",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
You insult me by talking such nonsense,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
I didnt mean it,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"But youre so easily offended,you know",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
The Mouse only growled in reply,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Please come back and finish your story,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Alice called after it; andthe others all joined in chorus, Yes, please do",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"but the Mouse onlyshook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
What a pity it wouldnt stay,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"sighed the Lory, as soon as it wasquite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying toher daughter Ah, my dear",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Let this be a lesson to you never to loseyour temper,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Hold your tongue, Ma",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"said the young Crab, a littlesnappishly",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Youre enough to try the patience of an oyster,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"said Alice aloud,addressing nobody in particular",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Shed soon fetch it back,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet:Dinahs our cat",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
And shes such a capital one for catching mice youcant think,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Why,shell eat a little bird as soon as look at it",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Some of thebirds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up verycarefully, remarking, I really must be getting home; the nightairdoesnt suit my throat",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"and a Canary called out in a trembling voiceto its children, Come away, my dears",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Its high time you were all inbed,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon leftalone",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
I wish I hadnt mentioned Dinah,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
she said to herself in a melancholytone,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Nobody seems to like her, down here, and Im sure shes the bestcat in the world",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Oh, my dear Dinah",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
I wonder if I shall ever see youany more,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt verylonely and lowspirited",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Oh my dear paws,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Ohmy fur and whiskers,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Shell get me executed, as sure as ferrets areferrets",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Where can I have dropped them, I wonder",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, andcalled out to her in an angry tone, Why, Mary Ann, what are youdoing out here",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves anda fan",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"And Alice was so much frightened that she ran offat once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain themistake it had made",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"He took me for his housemaid, she said to herself as she ran",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Howsurprised hell be when he finds out who I am,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"But Id better take himhis fan and glovesthat is, if I can find them",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"As she said this, shecame upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brassplate with the name W",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"RABBIT, engraved upon it",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"How queer it seems, Alice said to herself, to be going messages fora rabbit",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
I suppose Dinahll be sending me on messages next,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
And shebegan fancying the sort of thing that would happen: Miss Alice,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Comehere directly, and get ready for your walk",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Coming in a minute,nurse",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
But Ive got to see that the mouse doesnt get out,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Only Idont think, Alice went on, that theyd let Dinah stop in the houseif it began ordering people about like that",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"There was no labelthis time with the words DRINK ME, but nevertheless she uncorked itand put it to her lips",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I know something interesting is sure tohappen, she said to herself, whenever I eat or drink anything; soIll just see what this bottle does",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I do hope itll make me grow largeagain, for really Im quite tired of being such a tiny little thing",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
it was too late to wish that,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
What will become of me,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"It was much pleasanter at home, thought poor Alice, when one wasntalways growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice andrabbits",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I almost wish I hadnt gone down that rabbitholeand yetandyetits rather curious, you know, this sort of life",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
I do wonder whatcan have happened to me,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"When I used to read fairytales, I fanciedthat kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle ofone",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Andwhen I grow up, Ill write onebut Im grown up now, she added in asorrowful tone; at least theres no room to grow up any more here",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"But then, thought Alice, shall I never get any older than I amnow",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Thatll be a comfort, one waynever to be an old womanbutthenalways to have lessons to learn",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Oh, I shouldnt like that",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Oh, you foolish Alice",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
How can you learnlessons in here,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Why, theres hardly room for you, and no room at allfor any lessonbooks",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Fetch me my gloves this moment,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, asthe door opened inwards, and Alices elbow was pressed hard against it,that attempt proved a failure",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Alice heard it say to itself Then Illgo round and get in at the window,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fanciedshe heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out herhand, and made a snatch in the air",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Next came an angry voicethe RabbitsPat,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Andthen a voice she had never heard before, Sure then Im here",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Diggingfor apples, yer honour",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Digging for apples, indeed",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
said the Rabbit angrily,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Come andhelp me out of this,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Sounds of more broken glass,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Now tell me, Pat, whats that in the window",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Sure, its an arm, yer honour",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
He pronounced it arrum,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"An arm, you goose",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Who ever saw one that size,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Why, it fills the wholewindow",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Sure, it does, yer honour: but its an arm for all that",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Well, its got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispersnow and then; such as, Sure, I dont like it, yer honour, at all, atall",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Do as I tell you, you coward",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"and at last she spread out herhand again, and made another snatch in the air",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"This time there weretwo little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
What a numberof cucumberframes there must be,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
I wonder whattheyll do next,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish theycould",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Im sure I dont want to stay in here any longer,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Why, I hadnt to bring but one; Bills got the otherBill",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"fetch it here, lad",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Here, put em up at this cornerNo, tie emtogether firstthey dont reach half high enough yetOh",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"theyll dowell enough; dont be particularHere, Bill",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
catch hold of thisropeWill the roof bear,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Mind that loose slateOh, its coming down",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"a loud crashNow, who did that",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"It was Bill, IfancyWhos to go down the chimney",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"That I wont, then",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Bills to go downHere, Bill",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
the master saysyoure to go down the chimney,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"So Bills got to come down the chimney, has he",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I wouldnt be inBills place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; butI think I can kick a little",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
The first thing she heard was a general chorus of There goes Bill,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"then the Rabbits voice alongCatch him, you by the hedge",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"thensilence, and then another confusion of voicesHold up his headBrandynowDont choke himHow was it, old fellow",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
What happened to you,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Tellus all about it,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"So you did, old fellow",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
We must burn the house down,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"said the Rabbits voice; and Alicecalled out as loud as she could, If you do, Ill set Dinah at you",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, Iwonder what they will do next",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"If they had any sense, theyd take theroof off",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"After a minute or two, they began moving about again, andAlice heard the Rabbit say, A barrowful will do, to begin with",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
A barrowful of what,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Ill put a stop tothis, she said to herself, and shouted out, Youd better not do thatagain",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
which produced another dead silence,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning intolittle cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into herhead",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that shebegan shrinking directly",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"As soon as she was small enough to getthrough the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd oflittle animals and birds waiting outside",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"The poor little Lizard, Bill,was in the middle, being held up by two guineapigs, who were giving itsomething out of a bottle",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"They all made a rush at Alice the moment sheappeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herselfsafe in a thick wood",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
I think thatwill be the best plan,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, andfeebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
And yet what a dear little puppy it was,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Id nearly forgotten thatIve got to grow up again,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Let me seehow is it to be managed,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Isuppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the greatquestion is, what",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"The great question certainly was, what",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Alice looked all round her atthe flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything thatlooked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
What do you mean by that,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
said the Caterpillar sternly,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I cant explain myself, Im afraid, sir, said Alice, because Imnot myself, you see",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I dont see, said the Caterpillar",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"It isnt, said the Caterpillar",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Not a bit, said the Caterpillar",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Well, perhaps your feelings may be different, said Alice; all I knowis, it would feel very queer to me",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
said the Caterpillar contemptuously,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of anygood reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a very unpleasantstate of mind, she turned away",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
the Caterpillar called after her,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Ive somethingimportant to say,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Keep your temper, said the Caterpillar",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as shecould",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"No, said the Caterpillar",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do,and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Forsome minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfoldedits arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, So youthink youre changed, do you",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Im afraid I am, sir, said Alice; I cant remember things as Iusedand I dont keep the same size for ten minutes together",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Cant remember what things,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Well, Ive tried to say How doth the little busy bee, but it allcame different",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Alice replied in a very melancholy voice,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Repeat, You are old, Father William, said the Caterpillar",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I have answered three questions, and that is enough, Said his father; dont give yourself airs",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Be off, or Ill kick you down stairs",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"That is not said right, said the Caterpillar",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Not quite right, Im afraid, said Alice, timidly; some of thewords have got altered",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"It is wrong from beginning to end, said the Caterpillar decidedly,and there was silence for some minutes",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
The Caterpillar was the first to speak,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
What size do you want to be,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Oh, Im not particular as to size, Alice hastily replied; only onedoesnt like changing so often, you know",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I dont know, said the Caterpillar",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her lifebefore, and she felt that she was losing her temper",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Are you content now,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Well, I should like to be a little larger, sir, if you wouldntmind, said Alice: three inches is such a wretched height to be",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
It is a very good height indeed,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"said the Caterpillar angrily,rearing itself upright as it spoke it was exactly three inches high",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
But Im not used to it,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"And shethought of herself, I wish the creatures wouldnt be so easilyoffended",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Youll get used to it in time, said the Caterpillar; and it put thehookah into its mouth and began smoking again",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"In aminute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth andyawned once or twice, and shook itself",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
One side of what,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
The other side of what,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Of the mushroom, said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked italoud; and in another moment it was out of sight",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"However, atlast she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and brokeoff a bit of the edge with each hand",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
And now which is which,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"she said to herself, and nibbled a little ofthe righthand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt aviolent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Come, my heads free at last",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
What can all that green stuff be,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
And where have myshoulders got to,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"And oh, my poor hands, how is it I cant see you",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,except a little shaking among the distant green leaves",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Im not a serpent,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Serpent, I say again",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subduedtone, and added with a kind of sob, Ive tried every way, and nothingseems to suit them",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I havent the least idea what youre talking about, said Alice",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Ive tried the roots of trees, and Ive tried banks, and Ive triedhedges, the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; but thoseserpents",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Theres no pleasing them,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use insaying anything more till the Pigeon had finished",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"As if it wasnt trouble enough hatching the eggs, said the Pigeon;but I must be on the lookout for serpents night and day",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Why, Ihavent had a wink of sleep these three weeks",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Im very sorry youve been annoyed, said Alice, who was beginning tosee its meaning",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"But Im not a serpent, I tell you",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
I can see youre trying toinvent something,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"IIm a little girl, said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she rememberedthe number of changes she had gone through that day",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
A likely story indeed,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepestcontempt,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Ive seen a good many little girls in my time, but neverone with such a neck as that",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Youre a serpent; and theresno use denying it,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
I suppose youll be telling me next that you nevertasted an egg,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I have tasted eggs, certainly, said Alice, who was a very truthfulchild; but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, youknow",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I dont believe it, said the Pigeon; but if they do, why thentheyre a kind of serpent, thats all I can say",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"It matters a good deal to me, said Alice hastily; but Im notlooking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldnt wantyours: I dont like them raw",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Well, be off, then",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settleddown again into its nest",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Alice crouched down among the trees as wellas she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches,and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Come, theres half my plandone now",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
How puzzling all these changes are,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Im never sure what Imgoing to be, from one minute to another",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"However, Ive got back to myright size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful gardenhowis that to be done, I wonder",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"As she said this, she came suddenlyupon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Whoever lives there, thought Alice, itll never do to come upon themthis size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"So shebegan nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to gonear the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"It was opened byanother footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like afrog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curledall over their heads",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"She felt very curious to know what it was allabout, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
An invitation from theQueen to play croquet,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"The FrogFootman repeated, in the same solemntone, only changing the order of the words a little, From the Queen",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Theres no sort of use in knocking, said the Footman, and that fortwo reasons",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"First, because Im on the same side of the door as youare; secondly, because theyre making such a noise inside, no one couldpossibly hear you",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Please, then, said Alice, how am I to get in",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"There might be some sense in your knocking, the Footman went onwithout attending to her, if we had the door between us",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"For instance,if you were inside, you might knock, and I could let you out, youknow",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, andthis Alice thought decidedly uncivil",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"But perhaps he cant help it,she said to herself; his eyes are so very nearly at the top of hishead",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
But at any rate he might answer questions,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
How am I to get in,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"or next day, maybe, the Footman continued in the same tone, exactlyas if nothing had happened",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"asked Alice again, in a louder tone",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Are you to get in at all,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Thats the firstquestion, you know",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Its reallydreadful, she muttered to herself, the way all the creatures argue",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Its enough to drive one crazy,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating hisremark, with variations",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I shall sit here, he said, on and off, fordays and days",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
But what am I to do,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Anything you like, said the Footman, and began whistling",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Oh, theres no use in talking to him, said Alice desperately: hesperfectly idiotic",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
And she opened the door and went in,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Theres certainly too much pepper in that soup,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Alice said toherself, as well as she could for sneezing",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
There was certainly too much of it in the air,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Even the Duchess sneezedoccasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howlingalternately without a moments pause",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"The only things in the kitchenthat did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sittingon the hearth and grinning from ear to ear",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Please would you tell me, said Alice, a little timidly, for she wasnot quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, whyyour cat grins like that",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Its a Cheshire cat, said the Duchess, and thats why",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"They all can, said the Duchess; and most of em do",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I dont know of any that do, Alice said very politely, feeling quitepleased to have got into a conversation",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"You dont know much, said the Duchess; and thats a fact",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it wouldbe as well to introduce some other subject of conversation",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Oh, please mind what youre doing",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"cried Alice, jumping up and downin an agony of terror",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Oh, there goes his precious nose",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"as anunusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried itoff",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"If everybody minded their own business, the Duchess said in a hoarsegrowl, the world would go round a deal faster than it does",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Which would not be an advantage, said Alice, who felt very glad toget an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Justthink of what work it would make with the day and night,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"You see theearth takes twentyfour hours to turn round on its axisTalking of axes, said the Duchess, chop off her head",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"IOh, dont bother me, said the Duchess; I never could abidefigures",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
In which the cook and the baby joined:Wow,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"you may nurse it a bit, if you like",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"the Duchess said to Alice,flinging the baby at her as she spoke",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I must go and get ready to playcroquet with the Queen, and she hurried out of the room",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"The cookthrew a fryingpan after her as she went out, but it just missed her",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queershapedlittle creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions,just like a starfish, thought Alice",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"If I dont take this child away with me,thought Alice, theyre sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldnt it bemurder to leave it behind",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"She said the last words out loud, and thelittle thing grunted in reply it had left off sneezing by this time",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Dont grunt, said Alice; thats not at all a proper way ofexpressing yourself",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its faceto see what was the matter with it",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"But perhaps it was onlysobbing, she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if therewere any tears",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"No, there were no tears",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"If youre going to turn into a pig, my dear,said Alice, seriously, Ill have nothing more to do with you",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"The poor little thing sobbed again or grunted, it was impossibleto say which, and they went on for some while in silence",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Alice was just beginning to think to herself, Now, what am I to dowith this creature when I get it home",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"when it grunted again, soviolently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"This timethere could be no mistake about it: it was neither more nor less thana pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry itfurther",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see ittrot away quietly into the wood",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"If it had grown up, she said toherself, it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makesrather a handsome pig, I think",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"It looked goodnatured, shethought: still it had very long claws and a great many teeth, so shefelt that it ought to be treated with respect",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Cheshire Puss, she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all knowwhether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a littlewider",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Come, its pleased so far, thought Alice, and she went on",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"That depends a good deal on where you want to get to, said the Cat",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
I dont much care where said Alice,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Then it doesnt matter which way you go, said the Cat",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"so long as I get somewhere, Alice added as an explanation",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Oh, youre sure to do that, said the Cat, if you only walk longenough",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried anotherquestion",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
What sort of people live about here,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"In that direction, the Cat said, waving its right paw round, livesa Hatter: and in that direction, waving the other paw, lives aMarch Hare",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Visit either you like: theyre both mad,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"But I dont want to go among mad people, Alice remarked",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Oh, you cant help that, said the Cat: were all mad here",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
How do you know Im mad,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"You must be, said the Cat, or you wouldnt have come here",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Alice didnt think that proved it at all; however, she went on And howdo you know that youre mad",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"To begin with, said the Cat, a dogs not mad",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I suppose so, said Alice",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Well, then, the Cat went on, you see, a dog growls when its angry,and wags its tail when its pleased",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Now I growl when Im pleased,and wag my tail when Im angry",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I call it purring, not growling, said Alice",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Call it what you like, said the Cat",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Do you play croquet with theQueen today,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I should like it very much, said Alice, but I havent been invitedyet",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Youll see me there, said the Cat, and vanished",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queerthings happening",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"While she was looking at the place where it had been,it suddenly appeared again",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Bythebye, what became of the baby",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Id nearlyforgotten to ask,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"It turned into a pig, Alice quietly said, just as if it had come backin a natural way",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I thought it would, said the Cat, and vanished again",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Catagain, sitting on a branch of a tree",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Did you say pig, or fig",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I said pig, replied Alice; and I wish you wouldnt keep appearingand vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Ive often seen a cat without a grin, thought Alice; but agrin without a cat",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Its the most curious thing I ever saw in my life,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
I almost wish Id gone to see the Hatter instead,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Veryuncomfortable for the Dormouse, thought Alice; only, as its asleep,I suppose it doesnt mind",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together atone corner of it: No room",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
they cried out when they sawAlice coming,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Theres plenty of room,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"said Alice indignantly, andshe sat down in a large armchair at one end of the table",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Have some wine, the March Hare said in an encouraging tone",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I dont see any wine, she remarked",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"There isnt any, said the March Hare",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Then it wasnt very civil of you to offer it, said Alice angrily",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"It wasnt very civil of you to sit down without being invited, saidthe March Hare",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I didnt know it was your table, said Alice; its laid for a greatmany more than three",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Your hair wants cutting, said the Hatter",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"He had been looking atAlice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his firstspeech",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"You should learn not to make personal remarks, Alice said with someseverity; its very rude",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he saidwas, Why is a raven like a writingdesk",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Come, we shall have some fun now",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Im glad theyvebegun asking riddles,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I believe I can guess that, she added aloud",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Exactly so, said Alice",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Then you should say what you mean, the March Hare went on",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I do, Alice hastily replied; at leastat least I mean what Isaythats the same thing, you know",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Not the same thing a bit,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
You might just as wellsay that I see what I eat is the same thing as I eat what I see,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"You might just as well say, added the March Hare, that I like whatI get is the same thing as I get what I like",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
The Hatter was the first to break the silence,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
What day of the monthis it,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of hispocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,and holding it to his ear",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Alice considered a little, and then said The fourth",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
I told you butter wouldnt suitthe works,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
he added looking angrily at the March Hare,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"It was the best butter, the March Hare meekly replied",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well, the Hatter grumbled:you shouldnt have put it in with the breadknife",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"It tells the day of the month, and doesnttell what oclock it is",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Does your watch tell you whatyear it is,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Of course not, Alice replied very readily: but thats because itstays the same year for such a long time together",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Which is just the case with mine, said the Hatter",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Alice felt dreadfully puzzled, The Hatters remark seemed to have nosort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I dont quiteunderstand you, she said, as politely as she could",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"The Dormouse is asleep again, said the Hatter, and he poured a littlehot tea upon its nose",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening itseyes, Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Have you guessed the riddle yet,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"the Hatter said, turning to Aliceagain",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"No, I give it up, Alice replied: whats the answer",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I havent the slightest idea, said the Hatter",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Nor I, said the March Hare",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I think you might do something better with thetime, she said, than waste it in asking riddles that have noanswers",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"If you knew Time as well as I do, said the Hatter, you wouldnt talkabout wasting it",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I dont know what you mean, said Alice",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Of course you dont,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"the Hatter said, tossing his headcontemptuously",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
I dare say you never even spoke to Time,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Perhaps not, Alice cautiously replied: but I know I have to beattime when I learn music",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"that accounts for it, said the Hatter",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
He wont stand beating,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, hed do almost anythingyou liked with the clock",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"For instance, suppose it were nine oclock inthe morning, just time to begin lessons: youd only have to whisper ahint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Halfpast one,time for dinner",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I only wish it was, the March Hare said to itself in a whisper",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"That would be grand, certainly, said Alice thoughtfully: but thenIshouldnt be hungry for it, you know",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Not at first, perhaps, said the Hatter: but you could keep it tohalfpast one as long as you liked",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Is that the way you manage,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
The Hatter shook his head mournfully,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
How I wonder what youre at,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"You know the song, perhaps",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Ive heard something like it, said Alice",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"It goes on, you know, the Hatter continued, in this way:Up above the world you fly,Like a teatray in the sky",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Twinkle, twinkleHere the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleepTwinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle and went on so long that theyhad to pinch it to make it stop",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Well, Id hardly finished the first verse, said the Hatter, when theQueen jumped up and bawled out, Hes murdering the time",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"And ever since that, the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, he wontdo a thing I ask",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Its always six oclock now,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
A bright idea came into Alices head,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Is that the reason so manyteathings are put out here,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Yes, thats it, said the Hatter with a sigh: its always teatime,and weve no time to wash the things between whiles",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Then you keep moving round, I suppose",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Exactly so, said the Hatter: as the things get used up",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
But what happens when you come to the beginning again,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Suppose we change the subject, the March Hare interrupted, yawning",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Im getting tired of this,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
I vote the young lady tells us a story,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Im afraid I dont know one, said Alice, rather alarmed at theproposal",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Then the Dormouse shall,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Andthey pinched it on both sides at once,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I wasnt asleep, he said in ahoarse, feeble voice: I heard every word you fellows were saying",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Tell us a story,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
said the March Hare,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"And be quick about it, added the Hatter, or youll be asleep againbefore its done",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"said Alice, who always took a great interestin questions of eating and drinking",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"They lived on treacle, said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute ortwo",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"They couldnt have done that, you know, Alice gently remarked;theyd have been ill",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"So they were, said the Dormouse; very ill",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Take some more tea, the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Ive had nothing yet, Alice replied in an offended tone, so I canttake more",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"You mean you cant take less, said the Hatter: its very easy totake more than nothing",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Nobody asked your opinion, said Alice",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Whos making personal remarks now,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
the Hatter asked triumphantly,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself tosome tea and breadandbutter, and then turned to the Dormouse, andrepeated her question",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Why did they live at the bottom of a well,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and thensaid, It was a treaclewell",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Theres no such thing,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Alice was beginning very angrily, but theHatter and the March Hare went Sh",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"and the Dormouse sulkilyremarked, If you cant be civil, youd better finish the story foryourself",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"No, please go on",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Alice said very humbly; I wont interrupt again,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Idare say there may be one,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
said the Dormouse indignantly,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"However, he consented togo on",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"And so these three little sistersthey were learning to draw,you knowWhat did they draw",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"said Alice, quite forgetting her promise",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Treacle, said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I want a clean cup, interrupted the Hatter: lets all move one placeon",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Haremoved into the Dormouses place, and Alice rather unwillingly took theplace of the March Hare",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began verycautiously: But I dont understand",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Where did they draw the treaclefrom,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"You can draw water out of a waterwell, said the Hatter; so I shouldthink you could draw treacle out of a treaclewelleh, stupid",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"But they were in the well, Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosingto notice this last remark",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Of course they were, said the Dormouse; well in",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on forsome time without interrupting it",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Really, now you ask me, said Alice, very much confused, I dontthinkThen you shouldnt talk, said the Hatter",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
At any rate Ill never go there again,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
said Alice as she picked herway through the wood,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Its the stupidest teaparty I ever was at inall my life,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a doorleading right into it",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
I think I may as well go in at once,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the littleglass table",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Now, Ill manage better this time, she said to herself,and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door thatled into the garden",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"The Queens CroquetGroundA large rosetree stood near the entrance of the garden: the rosesgrowing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busilypainting them red",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Alice thought this a very curious thing, and shewent nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heardone of them say, Look out now, Five",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Dont go splashing paint over melike that,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I couldnt help it, said Five, in a sulky tone; Seven jogged myelbow",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"On which Seven looked up and said, Thats right, Five",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Always lay theblame on others,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Youd better not talk,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
I heard the Queen say onlyyesterday you deserved to be beheaded,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
said the one who had spoken first,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Thats none of your business, Two",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Yes, it is his business",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"said Five, and Ill tell himit was forbringing the cook tuliproots instead of onions",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Would you tell me, said Alice, a little timidly, why you arepainting those roses",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Soyou see, Miss, were doing our best, afore she comes, to At thismoment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, calledout The Queen",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
and the three gardeners instantly threwthemselves flat upon their faces,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"There was a sound of many footsteps,and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"After these camethe royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears camejumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were allornamented with hearts",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carryingthe Kings crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all thisgrand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"So she stood still where she was,and waited",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and lookedat her, and the Queen said severely Who is this",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"She said it to theKnave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning toAlice, she went on, Whats your name, child",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"My name is Alice, so please your Majesty, said Alice very politely;but she added, to herself, Why, theyre only a pack of cards, afterall",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
I neednt be afraid of them,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
And who are these,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
How should I know,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"said Alice, surprised at her own courage",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Itsno business of mine,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for amoment like a wild beast, screamed Off with her head",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen wassilent",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said Consider, mydear: she is only a child",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave Turnthem over",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the threegardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen,the royal children, and everybody else",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
You make me giddy,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"And then,turning to the rosetree, she went on, What have you been doinghere",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"May it please your Majesty, said Two, in a very humble tone, goingdown on one knee as he spoke, we were tryingI see",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Off with their heads,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"and the procession moved on, three of thesoldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ranto Alice for protection",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
You shant be beheaded,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"said Alice, and she put them into a largeflowerpot that stood near",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"The three soldiers wandered about for aminute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after theothers",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Are their heads off,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
the soldiers shoutedin reply,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Can you play croquet,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question wasevidently meant for her",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession,wondering very much what would happen next",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Itsits a very fine day,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
said a timid voice at her side,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"She waswalking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Very, said Alice: wheres the Duchess",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"He lookedanxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upontiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered Shes undersentence of execution",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Did you say What a pity,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"No, I didnt, said Alice: I dont think its at all a pity",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
She boxed the Queens ears the Rabbit began,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Alice gave a littlescream of laughter,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
the Rabbit whispered in a frightenedtone,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
The Queen will hear you,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"You see, she came rather late, and theQueen saidGet to your places",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
or Off with her head,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
about once in aminute,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Theyre dreadfullyfond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that theres anyone left alive",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
How are you getting on,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"said the Cat, as soon as there was mouthenough for it to speak with",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Its no usespeaking to it, she thought, till its ears have come, or at least oneof them",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice putdown her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very gladshe had someone to listen to her",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"The Cat seemed to think that therewas enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
How do you like the Queen,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
said the Cat in a low voice,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
The Queen smiled and passed on,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Who are you talking to,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"said the King, going up to Alice, andlooking at the Cats head with great curiosity",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Its a friend of minea Cheshire Cat, said Alice: allow me tointroduce it",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I dont like the look of it at all, said the King: however, it maykiss my hand if it likes",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Id rather not, the Cat remarked",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Dont be impertinent, said the King, and dont look at me likethat",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
He got behind Alice as he spoke,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"A cat may look at a king, said Alice",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Ive read that in some book,but I dont remember where",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Well, it must be removed, said the King very decidedly, and he calledthe Queen, who was passing at the moment, My dear",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
I wish you wouldhave this cat removed,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great orsmall",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Off with his head,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"she said, without even looking round",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Ill fetch the executioner myself, said the King eagerly, and hehurried off",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was goingon, as she heard the Queens voice in the distance, screaming withpassion",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
So she went in search of her hedgehog,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might notescape again, and went back for a little more conversation with herfriend",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"The Kings argument was, that anything that had a head could bebeheaded, and that you werent to talk nonsense",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"The Queens argument was, that if something wasnt done about it inless than no time shed have everybody executed, all round",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
It wasthis last remark that had made the whole party look so grave andanxious,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Alice could think of nothing else to say but It belongs to theDuchess: youd better ask her about it,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Shes in prison, the Queen said to the executioner: fetch her here",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
And the executioner went off like an arrow,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"The Mock Turtles StoryYou cant think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alices,and they walked off together",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"When Im a Duchess, she said to herself, not in a very hopefultone though, I wont have any pepper in my kitchen at all",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Youre thinkingabout something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I canttell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it ina bit",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Perhaps it hasnt one, Alice ventured to remark",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Everythings got a moral, if onlyyou can find it",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
And she squeezed herself up closer to Alices side asshe spoke,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"However, she did not like to be rude, so shebore it as well as she could",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"The games going on rather better now, she said, by way of keeping upthe conversation a little",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Tis so, said the Duchess: and the moral of that isOh, tis love,tis love, that makes the world go round",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Somebody said, Alice whispered, that its done by everybody mindingtheir own business",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
How fond she is of finding morals in things,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I dare say youre wondering why I dont put my arm round your waist,the Duchess said after a pause: the reason is, that Im doubtful aboutthe temper of your flamingo",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Shall I try the experiment,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"He might bite, Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxiousto have the experiment tried",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Very true, said the Duchess: flamingoes and mustard both bite",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Andthe moral of that isBirds of a feather flock together,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Only mustard isnt a bird, Alice remarked",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Right, as usual, said the Duchess: what a clear way you have ofputting things",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Its a mineral, I think, said Alice",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Of course it is, said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree toeverything that Alice said; theres a large mustardmine near here",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"And the moral of that isThe more there is of mine, the less there isof yours",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this lastremark, its a vegetable",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"It doesnt look like one, but it is",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I think I should understand that better, Alice said very politely,if I had it written down: but I cant quite follow it as you say it",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Thats nothing to what I could say if I chose, the Duchess replied,in a pleased tone",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Pray dont trouble yourself to say it any longer than that, saidAlice",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Oh, dont talk about trouble",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
I make you a presentof everything Ive said as yet,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
A cheap sort of present,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Im glad they dont givebirthday presents like that,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
But she did not venture to say it outloud,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharplittle chin",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Ive a right to think, said Alice sharply, for she was beginning tofeel a little worried",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Alice looked up, and there stood theQueen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like athunderstorm",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"A fine day, your Majesty",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"the Duchess began in a low, weak voice",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Now, I give you fair warning, shouted the Queen, stamping on theground as she spoke; either you or your head must be off, and that inabout half no time",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Lets go on with the game, the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was toomuch frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to thecroquetground",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrellingwith the other players, and shouting Off with his head",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
or Off withher head,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, Haveyou seen the Mock Turtle yet",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
I dont even know what a Mock Turtle is,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Its the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from, said the Queen",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I never saw one, or heard of one, said Alice",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Come on, then, said the Queen, and he shall tell you his history",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice,to the company generally, You are all pardoned",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Come, thats agood thing",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at thenumber of executions the Queen had ordered",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Ifyou dont know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"said the Queen, and take this young lady to see the MockTurtle, and to hear his history",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I must go back and see after someexecutions I have ordered; and she walked off, leaving Alice alonewith the Gryphon",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen tillshe was out of sight: then it chuckled,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"said the Gryphon,half to itself, half to Alice",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
What is the fun,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Why, she, said the Gryphon",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Its all her fancy, that: they neverexecutes nobody, you know",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Everybody says come on,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"here, thought Alice, as she went slowlyafter it: I never was so ordered about in all my life, never",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
What is his sorrow,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"she asked the Gryphon, and theGryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, Its allhis fancy, that: he hasnt got no sorrow, you know",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyesfull of tears, but said nothing",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"This here young lady, said the Gryphon, she wants for to know yourhistory, she do",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Ill tell it her, said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: sitdown, both of you, and dont speak a word till Ive finished",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Alice thought toherself, I dont see how he can ever finish, if he doesnt begin",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
But she waited patiently,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Once, said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, I was a realTurtle",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by anoccasional exclamation of Hjckrrh",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"from the Gryphon, and the constantheavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"When we were little, the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly,though still sobbing a little now and then, we went to school in thesea",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"The master was an old Turtlewe used to call him TortoiseWhy did you call him Tortoise, if he wasnt one",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"We called him Tortoise because he taught us, said the Mock Turtleangrily: really you are very dull",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"At last theGryphon said to the Mock Turtle, Drive on, old fellow",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Dont be allday about it,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"and he went on in these words:Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you maynt believe itI never said I didnt",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"You did, said the Mock Turtle",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
The Mock Turtle went on,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"We had the best of educationsin fact, we went to school every dayIve been to a dayschool, too, said Alice; you neednt be soproud as all that",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Yes, said Alice, we learned French and music",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
said the Mock Turtle,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"then yours wasnt a really good school, said the Mock Turtle in atone of great relief",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Now at ours they had at the end of the bill,French, music, and washingextra",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"You couldnt have wanted it much, said Alice; living at the bottomof the sea",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
I couldnt afford to learn it,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
said the Mock Turtle with a sigh,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Ionly took the regular course,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with, the Mock Turtlereplied; and then the different branches of ArithmeticAmbition,Distraction, Uglification, and Derision",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I never heard of Uglification, Alice ventured to say",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"You know what to beautify is, I suppose",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Yes, said Alice doubtfully: it meanstomakeanythingprettier",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Well, then, the Gryphon went on, if you dont know what to uglifyis, you are a simpleton",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, soshe turned to the Mock Turtle, and said What else had you to learn",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
What was that like,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Well, I cant show it you myself, the Mock Turtle said: Im toostiff",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
And the Gryphon never learnt it,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Hadnt time, said the Gryphon: I went to the Classics master,though",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"He was an old crab, he was",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I never went to him, the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: he taughtLaughing and Grief, they used to say",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"So he did, so he did, said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and bothcreatures hid their faces in their paws",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
And how many hours a day did you do lessons,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"said Alice, in a hurryto change the subject",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Ten hours the first day, said the Mock Turtle: nine the next, and soon",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
What a curious plan,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Thats the reason theyre called lessons, the Gryphon remarked:because they lessen from day to day",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a littlebefore she made her next remark",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Then the eleventh day must have beena holiday,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Of course it was, said the Mock Turtle",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
And how did you manage on the twelfth,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Alice went on eagerly,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Thats enough about lessons, the Gryphon interrupted in a verydecided tone: tell her something about the games now",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"The Lobster QuadrilleThe Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper acrosshis eyes",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute ortwo sobs choked his voice",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Same as if he had a bone in his throat,said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him inthe back",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"No, indeed, said Alice",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
What sort of a dance is it,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Why, said the Gryphon, you first form into a line along theseashoreTwo lines",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
cried the Mock Turtle,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;then, when youve cleared all the jellyfish out of the wayThat generally takes some time, interrupted the Gryphon",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
you advance twiceEach with a lobster as a partner,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Of course, the Mock Turtle said: advance twice, set to partnerschange lobsters, and retire in same order, continued the Gryphon",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Then, you know, the Mock Turtle went on, you throw theThe lobsters",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
as far out to sea as you canSwim after them,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Turn a somersault in the sea,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildlyabout",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"It must be a very pretty dance, said Alice timidly",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Would you like to see a little of it,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Very much indeed, said Alice",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Come, lets try the first figure",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
said the Mock Turtle to theGryphon,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"We can do without lobsters, you know",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Oh, you sing, said the Gryphon",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Ive forgotten the words,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
said a whiting to a snail,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Theres a porpoise close behind us, and hes treading on my tail",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
They are waiting on the shinglewill you come and join the dance,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Will you, wont you, will you, wont you, will you join the dance",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Will you, wont you, will you, wont you, wont you join the dance",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"You can really have no notion how delightful it will beWhen they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"But the snail replied Too far, too far",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"and gave a look askanceSaid he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
What matters it how far we go,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
his scaly friend replied,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"There is another shore, you know, upon the other side",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"The further off from England the nearer is to FranceThen turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Thank you, its a very interesting dance to watch, said Alice,feeling very glad that it was over at last: and I do so like thatcurious song about the whiting",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Oh, as to the whiting, said the Mock Turtle, theyyouve seen them,of course",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Yes, said Alice, Ive often seen them at dinn she checked herselfhastily",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I dont know where Dinn may be, said the Mock Turtle, but if youveseen them so often, of course you know what theyre like",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I believe so, Alice replied thoughtfully",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
They have their tails intheir mouthsand theyre all over crumbs,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Youre wrong about the crumbs, said the Mock Turtle: crumbs wouldall wash off in the sea",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
But they have their tails in their mouths;and the reason is here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut hiseyes,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Tell her about the reason and all that, he said to the Gryphon",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"The reason is, said the Gryphon, that they would go with thelobsters to the dance",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
So they got thrown out to sea,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
So they had tofall a long way,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
So they got their tails fast in their mouths,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
So theycouldnt get them out again,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Thank you, said Alice, its very interesting",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
I never knew so muchabout a whiting before,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I can tell you more than that, if you like, said the Gryphon",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Do youknow why its called a whiting,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I never thought about it, said Alice",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"It does the boots and shoes, the Gryphon replied very solemnly",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Alice was thoroughly puzzled,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Does the boots and shoes,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
she repeatedin a wondering tone,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Why, what are your shoes done with",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I mean, whatmakes them so shiny",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave heranswer",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Theyre done with blacking, I believe",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Boots and shoes under the sea, the Gryphon went on in a deep voice,are done with a whiting",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
And what are they made of,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Soles and eels, of course, the Gryphon replied rather impatiently:any shrimp could have told you that",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"If Id been the whiting, said Alice, whose thoughts were stillrunning on the song, Id have said to the porpoise, Keep back,please: we dont want you with us",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"They were obliged to have him with them, the Mock Turtle said: nowise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
said Alice in a tone of great surprise,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Of course not, said the Mock Turtle: why, if a fish came to me,and told me he was going a journey, I should say With what porpoise",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Dont you mean purpose,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I mean what I say, the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Andthe Gryphon added Come, lets hear some of your adventures",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I could tell you my adventuresbeginning from this morning, saidAlice a little timidly: but its no use going back to yesterday,because I was a different person then",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Explain all that, said the Mock Turtle",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"The adventures first, said the Gryphon in an impatient tone:explanations take such a dreadful time",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she firstsaw the White Rabbit,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Its all about as curious as it can be, said the Gryphon",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
It all came different,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Ishould like to hear her try and repeat something now,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind ofauthority over Alice,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Stand up and repeat Tis the voice of the sluggard, said theGryphon",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
thought Alice; I might as well be at school at once,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his noseTrims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Thats different from what I used to say when I was a child, saidthe Gryphon",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Well, I never heard it before, said the Mock Turtle; but it soundsuncommon nonsense",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands,wondering if anything would ever happen in a natural way again",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I should like to have it explained, said the Mock Turtle",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"She cant explain it, said the Gryphon hastily",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Go on with the nextverse,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
But about his toes,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
the Mock Turtle persisted,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"How could he turnthem out with his nose, you know",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Its the first position in dancing,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Alice said; but was dreadfullypuzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Go on with the next verse, the Gryphon repeated impatiently: itbegins I passed by his garden",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Its by far themost confusing thing I ever heard,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Yes, I think youd better leave off, said the Gryphon: and Alice wasonly too glad to do so",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind, Alicereplied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone,Hm",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
No accounting for tastes,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Sing her Turtle Soup, will you, oldfellow",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes chokedwith sobs, to sing this:Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,Waiting in a hot tureen",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Who for such dainties would not stoop,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Soooop of the eeevening, Beautiful, beautiful Soup",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Who cares for fish,Game, or any other dish",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Who would not give all else for two pennyworth only of beautiful Soup,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Soooop of the eeevening, Beautiful, beautiFUL SOUP",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begunto repeat it, when a cry of The trials beginning",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
was heard in thedistance,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it hurriedoff, without waiting for the end of the song",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
What trial is it,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon onlyanswered Come on,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"and ran the faster, while more and more faintlycame, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:Soooop of the eeevening, Beautiful, beautiful Soup",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"But there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking ateverything about her, to pass away the time",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Thats the judge, she said toherself, because of his great wig",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"However, jurymenwould have done just as well",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Alice whispered to the Gryphon,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"They cant have anythingto put down yet, before the trials begun",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Theyre putting down their names, the Gryphon whispered in reply,for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but shestopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, Silence in thecourt",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round,to make out who was talking",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,that all the jurors were writing down stupid things",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"on their slates,and she could even make out that one of them didnt know how to spellstupid, and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
A nicemuddle their slatesll be in before the trials over,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"This of course, Alicecould not stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, andvery soon found an opportunity of taking it away",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Herald, read the accusation",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Consider your verdict, the King said to the jury",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Not yet, not yet",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
the Rabbit hastily interrupted,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Theres a greatdeal to come before that,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Call the first witness, said the King; and the White Rabbit blewthree blasts on the trumpet, and called out, First witness",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
The first witness was the Hatter,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
He came in with a teacup in one handand a piece of breadandbutter in the other,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I beg pardon, yourMajesty, he began, for bringing these in: but I hadnt quite finishedmy tea when I was sent for",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"You ought to have finished, said the King",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
When did you begin,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into thecourt, arminarm with the Dormouse",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Fourteenth of March, I think itwas, he said",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Fifteenth, said the March Hare",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Sixteenth, added the Dormouse",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Take off your hat, the King said to the Hatter",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"It isnt mine, said the Hatter",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly madea memorandum of the fact",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I keep them to sell, the Hatter added as an explanation; Ive noneof my own",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter,who turned pale and fidgeted",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Give your evidence, said the King; and dont be nervous, or Illhave you executed on the spot",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I wish you wouldnt squeeze so, said the Dormouse, who was sittingnext to her",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
I can hardly breathe,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I cant help it, said Alice very meekly: Im growing",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Youve no right to grow here, said the Dormouse",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Dont talk nonsense, said Alice more boldly: you know youre growingtoo",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace, said the Dormouse: not inthat ridiculous fashion",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
And he got up very sulkily and crossed overto the other side of the court,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"on which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoesoff",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Give your evidence, the King repeated angrily, or Ill have youexecuted, whether youre nervous or not",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"It began with the tea, the Hatter replied",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Of course twinkling begins with a T,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
said the King sharply,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Do youtake me for a dunce,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Im a poor man, the Hatter went on, and most things twinkled afterthatonly the March Hare saidI didnt",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"He denies it, said the King: leave out that part",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said the Hatter went on, lookinganxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse deniednothing, being fast asleep",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"After that, continued the Hatter, I cut some more breadandbutterBut what did the Dormouse say",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
one of the jury asked,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"That I cant remember, said the Hatter",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"You must remember, remarked the King, or Ill have you executed",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and breadandbutter, and wentdown on one knee",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Im a poor man, your Majesty, he began",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Youre a very poor speaker, said the King",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Here one of the guineapigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed bythe officers of the court",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"As that is rather a hard word, I will justexplain to you how it was done",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"They had a large canvas bag, which tiedup at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guineapig,head first, and then sat upon it",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Im glad Ive seen that done, thought Alice",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"If thats all you know about it, you may stand down, continued theKing",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I cant go no lower, said the Hatter: Im on the floor, as it is",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Then you may sit down, the King replied",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Here the other guineapig cheered, and was suppressed",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Come, that finished the guineapigs",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Now we shall geton better,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Id rather finish my tea, said the Hatter, with an anxious look atthe Queen, who was reading the list of singers",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"You may go, said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court,without even waiting to put his shoes on",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"and just take his head off outside, the Queen added to one of theofficers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could getto the door",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Call the next witness,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
The next witness was the Duchesss cook,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Give your evidence, said the King",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Shant, said the cook",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice,Your Majesty must crossexamine this witness",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Pepper, mostly, said the cook",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Treacle, said a sleepy voice behind her",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Collar that Dormouse, the Queen shrieked out",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Turn that Dormouse out of court,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouseturned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook haddisappeared",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"said the King, with an air of great relief",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"And he added in an undertone to the Queen, Really, mydear, you must crossexamine the next witness",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
It quite makes myforehead ache,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Imagine hersurprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrilllittle voice, the name Alice",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
What do you know about this business,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
the King said to Alice,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Nothing whatever, said Alice",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Thats very important, the King said, turning to the jury",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Unimportant, of course, I meant, the King hastily said, and went onto himself in an undertone,importantunimportantunimportantimportant as if he were tryingwhich word sounded best",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Some of the jury wrote it down important, and some unimportant",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates;but it doesnt matter a bit, she thought to herself",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing inhis notebook, cackled out Silence",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"and read out from his book, RuleFortytwo",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
All persons more than a mile high to leave the court,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Everybody looked at Alice,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Im not a mile high, said Alice",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"You are, said the King",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Nearly two miles high, added the Queen",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Well, I shant go, at any rate, said Alice: besides, thats not aregular rule: you invented it just now",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Its the oldest rule in the book, said the King",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Then it ought to be Number One, said Alice",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"The King turned pale, and shut his notebook hastily",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Consider yourverdict, he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Theres more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty, said theWhite Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; this paper has just beenpicked up",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I havent opened it yet, said the White Rabbit, but it seems to be aletter, written by the prisoner toto somebody",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"It must have been that, said the King, unless it was written tonobody, which isnt usual, you know",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Who is it directed to,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
said one of the jurymen,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"It isnt directed at all, said the White Rabbit; in fact, theresnothing written on the outside",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"He unfolded the paper as he spoke,and added It isnt a letter, after all: its a set of verses",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Are they in the prisoners handwriting,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
asked another of the jurymen,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"No, theyre not, said the White Rabbit, and thats the queerestthing about it",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
The jury all looked puzzled,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"He must have imitated somebody elses hand, said the King",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
The juryall brightened up again,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Please your Majesty, said the Knave, I didnt write it, and theycant prove I did: theres no name signed at the end",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"If you didnt sign it, said the King, that only makes the matterworse",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"You must have meant some mischief, or else youd have signedyour name like an honest man",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first reallyclever thing the King had said that day,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"That proves his guilt, said the Queen",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
It proves nothing of the sort,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Why, you dont even knowwhat theyre about",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Read them, said the King",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
The White Rabbit put on his spectacles,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Where shall I begin, pleaseyour Majesty",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Begin at the beginning, the King said gravely, and go on till youcome to the end: then stop",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"He sent them word I had not gone We know it to be true:If she should push the matter on, What would become of you",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"I gave her one, they gave him two, You gave us three or more;They all returned from him to you, Though they were mine before",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"If I or she should chance to be Involved in this affair,He trusts to you to set them free, Exactly as we were",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"My notion was that you had been Before she had this fitAn obstacle that came between Him, and ourselves, and it",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Dont let him know she liked them best, For this must ever beA secret, kept from all the rest, Between yourself and me",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
I dont believe theresan atom of meaning in it,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"The jury all wrote down on their slates, She doesnt believe theresan atom of meaning in it, but none of them attempted to explain thepaper",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"If theres no meaning in it, said the King, that saves a world oftrouble, you know, as we neednt try to find any",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"And yet I dontknow, he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking atthem with one eye; I seem to see some meaning in them, after all",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"said I could not swim you cant swim, can you",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"he added, turningto the Knave",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
The Knave shook his head sadly,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Do I look like it,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Which hecertainly did not, being made entirely of cardboard",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Why, there they are",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"said the King triumphantly, pointing to thetarts on the table",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Nothing can be clearer than that,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Thenagainbefore she had this fit you never had fits, my dear, Ithink",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
he said to the Queen,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizardas she spoke",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Then the words dont fit you, said the King, looking round thecourt with a smile",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
There was a dead silence,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"the King added in an offended tone, and everybodylaughed, Let the jury consider their verdict, the King said, forabout the twentieth time that day",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
The idea of having thesentence first,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"said the Queen, turning purple",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Off with her head,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
the Queen shouted at the top of her voice,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Who cares for you,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"said Alice, she had grown to her full size bythis time",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
Youre nothing but a pack of cards,Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Wake up, Alice dear",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"said her sister; Why, what a long sleep youvehad",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"Oh, Ive had such a curious dream",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
"So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might,what a wonderful dream it had been",Project Gutenberg - Alice in Wonderland
